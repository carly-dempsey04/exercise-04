# Assignment 4 - Wordle

Creating a function to load in my files

```{r}
library(readr)
#Creating the function load_dictionary 
load_dictionary <- function(filename, sep = "\t", header = TRUE) {
  read.table(file = filename, header = header, sep = sep, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
}

valid_list <- load_dictionary("collins-scrabble-words-2019.txt")
class(valid_list)
str(valid_list)

solution_list <- load_dictionary("google-10000-english-usa-no-swears.txt")
class(solution_list)
str(valid_list)
```

Step 2 - reducing the variables in the **solution_list** to only those that are also included in the valid_list

```{r}
solution_list1 <- intersect(solution_list, valid_list)

```
