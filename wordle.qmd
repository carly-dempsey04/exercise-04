# Assignment 4 - Wordle

Creating a function to load in my files

```{r}
library(readr)
load_dictionary <- function(filename) {
  readr::read_table(
    file = filename,
    col_names = TRUE)
}
valid_list <- collins.scrabble.words.2019
str(valid_list)

load_dictionary <- function(google.10000.english.usa.no.swears) {
  readr::read_table(
    file = filename,
    col_names = TRUE)
}
solution_list <- google.10000.english.usa.no.swears
str(solution_list)
class(solution_list)

```

Step 2 - reducing the variables in the **solution_list** to only those that are also included in the valid_list

```{r}
solution_list1 <- intersect(valid_list, solution_list)

```
